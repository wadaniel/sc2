# Run 4
-excluded training invTemperature
-comparing 4 runs, 2 envs with GRU vs FFN

# Run 9
- included training invTemperature
- investigate NaN / crash
- 2 run, GRU vs FFN (6h_vs_8z)

# Finding
invTemperature helped in run 9, as well as GRU, no crashes

# Run 10
- included training invTemperature
- 2 run, GRU (6mvs8m, 6h_vs_8z)

# Added some runs with ts 20
# Run 10

# Finding
training much slower,

# Run 11
- 1 run, FFN 6h_vs_8z
- check impact multi agent correlation (mode 1)
- check impact cooperation (mode 3)
- check impact cooperation w multi agent correlation (mode 4)

# Finding
mode 1 stabilizes learning, mode 3 TODO, mode 4 TODO
